# Shiftgig OnDemand

When Shiftgig integrated their sub-brand, Bullpen, into the main Shiftgig name in 2015, I was in charge of converting the Bullpen website into an on-brand, responsive experience. I took this project from initial wireframing all the way through the final front-end web build, supported by content and direction from the marketing team.

This archived version of the site has been stripped of php processors, embedded forms, and outbound links. Some of the CTA buttons no longer work as a result.
